Few things to keep in mind while running the submitted program.

The program works the best when the all the characteristics for the firework
are set. It will still draw the trajectory based on a the pre-programmed values if few values are missing — it will however, throw exceptions in the console but will not effect the working of the program. 

The program will draw anything if angle, speed or time are either set to 0 or let unchanged

After inputing values into JTextField please remember to press enter for the program to register the value

The program accepts angles in degrees from the user


Mutiliple fireworks can be fired at the same time.

There is a choice for a firework that splits off after specified time by the user and 
Its components fly off with respect to its current position and initial speed to burst 
After 2 time units.

I programmed another type of missile named bunker buster that
Shoots off horizontally and then flies down to burst after specified time but is rocket propelled thus follows an upward parabolic route — to allow for more choice in the program
